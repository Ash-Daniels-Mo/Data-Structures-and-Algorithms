        "\n",
        "Given an array of integers and an integer target value, the task is to identify two distinct elements within the array whose sum is equal to the target. The solution should return the indices of these two elements. Each input is guaranteed to have exactly one valid solution, and the same element cannot be used twice.\n",

        "## 2. Explanation of the Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "This problem requires searching through a list of numbers to find a pair that adds up to a specified target value. Since array elements are accessed using indices starting from 0, the goal is not merely to find the two numbers, but to return their positions in the array.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, consider the array:   [2, 7, 11, 15]\n",
        "and a target value of `9`.\n",

        "We examine possible pairs and observe that `2 + 7 = 9`. The corresponding indices of these values are `0` and `1`. Therefore, the correct output is `[0, 1]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "The essential task is to efficiently identify such a pair without checking every possible combination, especially as the size of the input grows.\n",

        "\n",
        "## 3. Algorithm\n",
        "\n",
        "To solve the problem efficiently, a hash map (dictionary) is used to keep track of elements already encountered and their corresponding indices. This approach allows constant-time lookup while iterating through the array only once.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Algorithm Steps:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Initialize an empty dictionary named `seen` to store previously encountered numbers along with their indices.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Iterate through the array using an index `i`:\n",
        "\n",
        "   * Let `current` be the value at index `i`.\n",
        "   * Compute `needed = target - current`.\n",
        "   * Check if `needed` already exists in the dictionary:\n",
        "\n",
        "     * If it does, a valid pair has been found. Return the indices `[seen[needed], i]`.\n",
        "   * If not, store the current number and its index in the dictionary as `seen[current] = i`.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. If the loop finishes without finding a pair, return no solution (though the problem guarantees one).\n",
