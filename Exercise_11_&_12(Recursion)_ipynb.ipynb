        "Given the head of a singly linked list and an integer value `val`, the task is to remove **all nodes** from the linked list whose value is equal to `val`.  \n",
        "After removing these nodes, return the **new head** of the linked list.\n",

        "## 2. Explanation of the Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "A linked list is a sequence of nodes where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of this problem is to traverse the linked list and remove every node whose value matches the given integer `val`.\n",
        "\n",
        "One important challenge is that the **head node itself may need to be removed**. This means we cannot assume that the head of the list will always remain the same.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, consider the linked list:\n",
        "\n",
        "```\n",
        "1 → 2 → 6 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6\n",

        "If `val = 6`, all nodes with value `6` must be removed.  \n",

        "\n",
        "1. Create a dummy node that points to the head of the linked list.\n",

        "   - If not, move the pointer forward.\n",
        "4. Continue until the end of the list is reached.\n",
        "5. Return the node following the dummy node as the new head.\n",
